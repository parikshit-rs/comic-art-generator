## How APIs Work

An application programming interface(API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. APIs work by sharing data between applications, systems, and devices. This happens through a request and response cycle. A user initiates a request for data by interacting with an application.

Comics and mangas are popular forms of visual storytelling. They combine illustrations and text to convey narratives, often in a series of panels. Comics are a versatile medium, ranging from humorous strips to elaborate graphic novels, while mangas are a specific style of comics originating in Japan with a distinctive artistic and narrative approach.
